# Pokedex
This is a small website created using create-react-app and the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). It provides a simple Pokedex that you can use to look at Pokemon and information about them. It also showcases a game where the user has to try and guess all the Pokemon from a particular generation.

It makes use of [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) to create simple, but smooth designs, and [react-usestateref](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-usestateref) to make the use of the component state easier.

## Setup
To run the website on your device, clone the repo onto a device with NodeJS and npm installed, and run the following commands.

```
npm install
npm start
```

The website will automatically open up, or you can also access it on localhost:3000
